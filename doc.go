// Package turtle implements functions for parsing and serializing
// of the Turtle format used for representing RDF data. This package
// covers most features of the format's version 1.1.
//
// The API of the package follows the Golang's traditional pattern
// for serializing and parsing. The serializing operation happens
// through the Marshal function. Function Unmarshal serves as a parser.
